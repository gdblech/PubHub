# PubHub

## What is PubHub?
Currently traditional pen/paper pub trivia has several inconveniences for players: hard to read screens, slow and cumbersome scorekeeping, cheating, not to mention ordering drinks and food throughout the game take away from the trivia experience.

PubHub resolves these issues by giving players a digital interface. This will allow users to play on their own devices such as phones or tablets. Grading answers will be randomized to prevent cheating, and scores will be calculated automatically, reducing the time spent scorekeeping. In addition, players will be able to order food and drinks as well as pay their bill from the comfort of their seats.

PubHub will be a combination of technologies that will work together to implement this solution. It will involve a website for the pub interface (management of trivia, chat moderation, bar menu, and processing orders), a mobile application for patrons (trivia, chat, and ordering), and a backend web service to connect all the users.
